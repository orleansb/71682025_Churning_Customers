# 71682025_Churning_Customers

This project is to predict whether or not a customer churns and shows the confidence score.   
  Input is entered, and a keras model is used to predict the answer
  The application uses a dataset and extracts relevant features. 
  Feature preprocessing was done, and the relevant features were extracted; I looked at the relation between the different features and how they are related to churn
  I then trained a Keras functional API using cross-validation and grid search.

  I then optimised the model to get the highest accuracy and reduce the loss .
